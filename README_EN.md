## A Story About Freedom

Every software user has faced this choice: pay for a beautifully crafted application with all the features, or settle for a "good enough" free alternative that feels like a compromise?

Behind this choice lies an unspoken assumption—something we rarely question: free means inferior. Free means ugly. Free means missing features, intrusive ads, and a user experience that reminds you why you should have paid in the first place.

We've accepted this for so long that we've forgotten what software used to look like.

## We Believe The World Can Be Different

One day, in the mind of an ordinary developer, an restless thought emerged: what if we weren't trying to make money? What if we just wanted to make the world a little bit better—what kind of software would we create?

That thought gave birth to JitterPay.

This isn't a commercial product. There are no investors, no IPO plans, no financial statements to balance. It's just a pure intention—to prove that free software can do everything paid software can do, and perhaps even more. Beautiful interfaces, smooth experiences, thoughtful features, robust privacy protection—these shouldn't be luxury goods you have to purchase.

Every line of code in JitterPay tells a simple story: you don't need to pay for excellent software.

## Every Line of Code Is A Promise

No in-app purchases. No subscriptions. No "unlock premium features" buttons. Download, install, use—that's it. Completely free.

We don't sell your data. We don't fill your interface with advertisements. We don't tempt you with upgrade prompts. What you receive is the complete software—complete functionality, complete respect.

Behind this is countless hours of thinking, coding, testing, and iterating. Every pixel, every animation, every interaction has been refined repeatedly. We care about this software as if it were a gift to the world.

## A Dream Of An Ecosystem

JitterPay is just the beginning.

The true vision is to create a complete ecosystem of free software. In this ecosystem, office applications, media players, image editors, development tools, communication apps—every tool you need has a free, beautiful, and powerful alternative.

Imagine a world where you don't see a long list of software subscription fees on your bill. A world where you don't have to upgrade to a paid version just to unlock a feature. A world where you don't worry about next month's price increase or feature changes. In this ecosystem, software is free, users are free, innovation is free.

The dream is vast, perhaps too vast for one person to achieve. But every user who joins this ecosystem, every contributor, every advocate—makes this dream a little more real.

## Your Participation Makes The Dream Come True

This isn't a "use and forget" utility app. This is a conversation about what software should be.

You can choose to download and use it, discovering its beauty in daily use. You can share it with friends, letting more people know that free doesn't mean compromise. You can contribute code in the open-source community, making it better. You can share your experience on social media, showing the world: look, free software can reach this level.

Every form of participation is a vote—a vote for believing that software can be free, beautiful, and belong to everyone.
